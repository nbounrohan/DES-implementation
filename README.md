# DES-implementation
implementation of des cipher using hardware descriptive language
DES is a block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. This project provides a functional implementation of the DES algorithm in VHDL, including:

Key Generation
Initial Permutation (IP)
Round Functions (16 rounds of Feistel structure)
Final Permutation (FP)
Encryption and Decryption support
